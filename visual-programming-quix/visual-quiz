by visual quiz, i mean that we show the user a visual cue,
and ask them to replicate it - 
for example, we show them an image of a matrix or an array
and ask them to reproduce it/generate it
we ask them to reproduce a specific slice of an array or a
matrix using slicing.

similarly, we can also have a visual quiz to teach HTML/CSS/JS
stuff - we ask them to replicate a certain layout, a certain font
type or a font size, a specific action or a specific animation.

or Qt and C++/Python

visual cues are always better and a lot more rewarding.

it'll also be awesome if we could sort of have three panes -
top half is split into two vertical panes - on the left what
we desire and on the right what our code currently does.
and on the bottom half of the screen, we have our actual code.
that way, we will be able to see changes in our code reflect
in the changes on how it looks and immediately compare and
iterate.
