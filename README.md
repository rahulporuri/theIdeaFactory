ideas/projects that I hope to work on in the near/distant future

1. a map of nations where clicking on any nation will provide information on how their currency looks (paper and coin), how it compares to the $, what ffraction of their transactions are done digitally vs in cash.
Of specific interest to me is how each country tries preventing counterfiet notes and coins.
More items to include would be what materials the currency (notes and coins) are made of, what denominations are available.

2. Colors and what items were used to make them in the past. Before we were able to manufacture colors on an industrial scale, natural plants were used to generate colors. What plants and what colors?

3. Elements and the items you most prolly find them in e.g. Carbon -> living organisms. Oxygen, Nitrogen -> Air. Mg? Al? Ni?

4. Given an item, guess what all elements are present in the item.

5. An AR app that will be able to recognize objects in front of the camera, annotate them with basic information of the object's identity and provide further information on composition. It'd also be interesting to know of any interesting history that the object has.

6. An AR educational app.

7. a social network that asks you to pay to join. it wont track you, it wont sell your data, it will promote active discussions and share opposing points of view. promoting paid services is going to pay off in the long term because we have a network that is willing to pay.

8. Twitter API for info on people im following, starting with info on tweets, retweets and so on - to understand who is crowding my feed.

9. build a scaled model of the solar system.

10. how does a human microbiome compare to a primate microbiome?

11. Indian national parks

12. compare roadworks vs railways budget; how much money goes into building/maintaining roads vs tracks

13. dude where's my flight

14. dude where's the ATM

15. the equivalent of the US collegescorecard for Indian unis. https://collegescorecard.ed.gov

16. what do we do with India's water levels - https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/india_water.html

17. isochrone of travel time to various locations in Indian metro cities - WaPo D.C. public transit

18. make a dummy android app with access to the fastah project, install app on cheap phones and give it to a taxi driver i can trust.
or put them on multiple drones and automate their movement. popularize the app to get more people to use it.

19. Errors in various languages - how similar and different they are. which language has the most readable and helpful error messages and what is the policy?

20. a bicycle rent startup - start at big colleges e.g. IIT, NIT, BITS, SRM, VIT etc. see Chinese equivalents

21. an AddOn that logs the download size of every page. or better, simply crawl the web and log how big the pages are. one website at a time.

22. a browser that automatically opens webpages in reading mode - stripping out all of the images, notifying the user when a page had heavy use of JS and what not.

23. create website where graduates can provide advice, in person, to school students or parents looking for information on college programs.

24. create a website where college grad students can provide their contact information. rather, this could simply be a dept webpage ripoff.

25. saffron and where it is grown. is it grown in India? if not, why not?
