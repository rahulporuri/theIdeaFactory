a chrome/firefox extension would would look at reviews, be it on a product
on amazon/flipkart or on an app in the playstore/appstore, and highlight
reviews which are authentic and meaningful. There are a lot of junk/generic
reviews on products/apps and looking for meaningful ones is time consuming.

There could be an optional search option in the extension where the user could
specifically search the genuine reviews for a specific word, a word which could
help the user swing towards or away from the product/app.
