from the GitHub API, can we get what issues are solved faster - by tag,
are the descriptive issues solved faster or those without, does the
comment thread on the issue matter in deciding how fast an issue gets
closed? What is the average time it takes for an issue to get closed?

similarly, what type of PRs get merged faster? PRs with labels, with
a good discussion thread? How long do they normally take, and so on.
