a slack bot that listens to the :standup: tag and copies over the
information that follows the :standup: tag into a seperate channel.
this new channel will only contain standup posts.

which will, in the future, be aggregarted by people, by day and
by topic, if need be, so that one person in one corner of a company
can talk about exactly what he's working on with someone else in
another corner.
