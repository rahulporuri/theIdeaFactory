The ^ link shows a heat map of the incidence of measles in the USA over time.
There is a stark drop in the number if measles infections reported around 1965,
which coincides with the introduction of the measles vaccine.

A similar plot for other infectious diseases would be interesting, be it for data
recorded in the US or other countries. Such plots in an Indian context are
buzz-worthy.
